# Vertecology
Designs for an octahedron/helical hanging structure for vertical gardening. 

<!-- Theres nothing here yet... but there will be as the contents get shared in the next few days. -->

The Vertecology Hanging Garden was concieved as a DIY or maker-economy generated structure for the urban gardener. Itâ€™s great for veggies, starts, herbs, vines, succulents, microgreens or all of the above. You can hang it from anything able to support its weight as long as it has 3 stable overhead connection points to lock into. Its elegant geometry makes it not only a stunning conversation piece, but also incredibly strong, wind-resistant (tested to 50 mph) and assembleable with little more than knotted rope.

There's a lot more possible with the basic octahedral design than just gardening. A few ideas that have come my way include cat structures, shelving, aquaponics, even handling suspended machine components that need to be precisely moved in three dimensions with a minimum of committed materials.

Here I'm sharing the plans and files with the wide world of makers out there so that the collective can do great things with this basic concept.
